## Running the tests

### Test Setup

To run the Diego Acceptance tests, you will need:
- a running CF instance
- credentials for an Admin user
- an environment variable `$CONFIG` which points to a `.json` file that contains the application domain

**NOTE**: The secure_address must be some inaccessible endpoint from
  any container, e.g., an etcd endpoint

### Running the tests against a bosh-lite

`./scripts/bosh_lite_run_wats.sh`

### Self signed certificates

If you are running the tests with version newer than `6.0.2-0bba99f`
of the Go CLI against bosh-lite or any other environment using
self-signed certificates, add the following

```
  "skip_ssl_validation": true
```

to your config file as well.
